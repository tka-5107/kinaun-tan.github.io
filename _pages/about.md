About me 
======
I am a third year PhD student at National University of Singapore (NUS), Department of Mathematics. I am currently working on research in stochastics under the supervision of Prof. Subhroshekhar Ghosh. I am broadly interested in stochastics theory, random point processes and topological data analysis. Prior to embarking on my PhD at NUS, I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2021. 


Research Experiences 
======
1. National University of Singapore (May 2023 ~ present) <br>
  Topological Data Analysis. Applying Persistent Holomogy into signal processing including detection and denoising. 

2. National University of Singapore (April 2023 ~ present) <br>
   Learning conjugation invariant class functions on rotated images via machine learning.

3. National University of Singapore (December 2022 ~ May 2023) <br>
   Connecting approximate Gibbsian properties to generalized Gibbsian properties. Refer to the publication.

4. National University of Singapore (2022) <br>
   Attempted to extend Wainwright's work on edge recovery in high dimensional Ising model using $$l_1$$-regularized logistic regression onto more general Potts model.
