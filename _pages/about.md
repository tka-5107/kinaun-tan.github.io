About me 
======
I am a third year PhD student at National University of Singapore (NUS), Department of Mathematics. I am currently working on research in stochastics under the supervision of Prof. Subhroshekhar Ghosh. I am broadly interested in stochastics theory, random point processes and topological data analysis. Prior to embarking on my PhD at NUS, I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2021.
